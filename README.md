# python chatserver

## an itsy bitsy chat server (roughly 60 lines sloc including client and server)
### features:<br>
	completely anonymous, ip not stored on server
	commands can be added (currently servermsg and exit are the only commands)
	very hackable
### installation:
	download client.py and run it for the client
	download server.py and run it on the server
	thats literally it
