# python chatserver

## an itsy bitsy chat server (roughly 60 lines sloc including client and server)
### features:<br>
	completely anonymous, ip not stored on server<br>
	commands can be added (currently servermsg and exit are the only commands)<br>
	very hackable<br>
### installation:<br>
	download client.py and run it for the client<br>
	download server.py and run it on the server<br>
	thats literally it<br><br>

took me like 2 hours to make lmao
